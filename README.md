# Custom Library for Arrays in Rust
## Implementing:
+ Custom Arrays for one/two dimensional Arrays
+ according functions

## How to use:
Import Library with: `rarray = { git = "https://github.com/OfflineBot/RustArrayLib.git" }`.
Then use `use rarray::Array1` to use one dimensional Arrays and `use rarray::Array2` for two dimensional Arrays.
The Library is mainly focused on deep learning mathematical operations and for f32/f64 types.
